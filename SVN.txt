SVN Project
For this project you will use Subversion to perform revision control on
your studying the material in this module. Specifically, you will work through
the study guide answering each question. For each question in the study guide
you answer you will perform a commit, with appropriate message, to capture
that instance of your progress. You will use GitHub to host as server for this
project.
Your workflow should be
1. Create a repository on GitHub for this project
2. Create the local working copy on your computer with the GitHub repository
you create for this project serving as the server
3. Add the study guide to the repository
4. Commit
5. Answer a question then go back to 3
Remember, do not go back and change the past, if you forget to make a
commit for an answer, then explain that in your next commit message. In
short: leave the past alone and always work forward!
